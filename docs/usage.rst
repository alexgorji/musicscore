1. Check the version of python on your computer: `python --version`. This library has been developed under ``python 3.9``. Possibly you
have to install this version (for example via Homebrew or whatever way you choose.)

    * mkdir <project>
    * cd <project>
    * python3 -m venv venv
    * source venv/bin/activate
    * pip install --upgrade pip
